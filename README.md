## Support
This app was made for fun to find original technical solutions to display slides on a chromecast (besides miracast ;)).
I don't  plan to provide any support neither to update it. But who knows ...
Therefore i took the time to release it as open source. it might be useful to someone.
Do not hesitate to modify it, update it, or fork it.

This app uses other open source libraries :
- NanoHttpd
- Android Annotations
- Viewer.js
- XStream
- Active Android
- Android Iconify
- Licences Dialog
- EventBus
- GSon
- OkHttp
